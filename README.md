# ‚òÅÔ∏è In-admin Applications

> An "In-Admin App", is an application that runs and executes within the context of Nuvemshop's administration panel, through the use of an iframe. The purpose of building in-admin apps is to provide integrations that feel more seamless and native.

> The objective of this project is to provide the developer with tools and examples to create such an embedded application. We will also provide 3 example applications: (1) one simple front end app in react, (2) one simple front end app in vanilla js, (3) a simple back end application written in node js that can connect with the previous two example front end apps.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Let's start

Before we start let's do a macro view to understand the main actors with their responsibilities and initiation flow

## üé≠ Actors

As a developer, you will be responsible for developing the code in the In-Admin App. Your app, will be connected to the Nuvemshop Admin, through an SDK called Nexo. We are going to briefly describe the responsibilities of each Actor:

### In-admin App
This is the application that you will write. The application has to be a simple HTML document with public access via an URL. Below, you will find comprehensive documentation about how Nexo works. For now, we will just describe the basics:
- Use Start Nexo to initialize message exchange between the Admin, and the App (this will start the bridge for future communications)
- After initialization, you will have to explicitely Notify that the application is ready to be shown, this way, the Admin will render it
- Finally, you will execute the In-App business model logic

### Nexo
Tool developed in JS for the communication between the Admin and the Application
- Being the bridge for communications between the Admin and the Application `bridge`
- Management of actions `patterns`
- Tools provider `tools`

### Admin
Admin actor is responsible for managing the currently logged in Nuvemshop merchant, which means:
- Activate development mode: allows developers to test applications without the need of them being formally approved in our Appstore (see below how to activate this for your app)
- Define the access for the application (routes): Nuvemshop will provide you with a route (URL), in which your application will be summoned.
- Access the application through the iframe `iframe`
- Start Nexo for message exchange `bridge`
- Check if the application is ready to load within the Admin `verify`
- Management of session token that will validate the authenticity of a Store with an active session `authentication`

## üí¨ Introduction to Nexo
It is a tool developed by Nuvemshop that allows us to establish communication with the Admin and also manage the actions that can be carried out between the application and the administrator.

Nexo is available through NPM
```bash
npm install @tiendanube/nexo
```

It is an essential requirement that the application generates an instance of Nexo to be able to execute the actions

The Nexo instance allows you to enter 2 parameters to start:


| Config   |  Type                     | Description                                                        |
|----------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| clientId | `string` required         | App Id, this value is provided by Nuvemshop in Partners Portal      |
| log      | `boolean` default `false` | Allows to show the message transfers between the App and the Admin |

The logs are available through the browser console

## üíª Developer Mode
> This functionality is only available for previously enabled Stores. To access this functionality, request it through a contact at Nuvemshop

With the Developer Mode option activated you will have a new option available in the menu with the name "*Aplicativo de teste o Aplicaci√≥n de Prueba*". By entering this option you can enter the URL of the application
