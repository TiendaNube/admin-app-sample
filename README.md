# ‚òÅÔ∏è In-admin Applications

> An "In-Admin App", is an application that runs and executes within the context of Nuvemshop's administration panel, through the use of an iframe. The purpose of building in-admin apps is to provide integrations that feel more seamless and native.

The objective of this project is to provide the developer with tools and examples to create such an embedded application. We will also provide 3 example applications: (1) one simple front end app in react, (2) one simple front end app in vanilla js, (3) a simple back end application written in node js that can connect with the previous two example front end apps.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Let's start

Before we start let's do a macro view to understand the main actors with their responsibilities and initiation flow

![Untitled_2022-12-07_17-53-25](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44773699/206258946-38ecedf7-dbba-4515-a7c3-de8dc9ae4799.png)


As we can see in the graph above, we find 3 actors that interact with each other. They are the application developed by the partner hereinafter **In-admin app**, Nuvemshop's administration panel hereinafter **Admin** and SDK that allows connecting to the Admin and In-admin App hereinafter **Nexo**.


## üé≠ Let's know the responsibilities of each one of the actors

### In-admin App
This is the application that you will write. The application has to be a simple HTML document with public access via an URL. This application will be loaded within the Admin through an iframe, it is for this reason that we require the public URL of the application.

For the **In-admin App** to be compatible with **Admin** it is necessary to have **Nexo** installed and configured, below you will find comprehensive documentation about how Nexo works.

For now, we'll just describe important steps:
- You will have to use Nexo to initialize the communication between the In-admin App and the Admin. [How to initialize the communication?](...)
- After the communication has initialized, In-admin App will have to explicitly notify the Admin that the application is ready to be shown. [How to communicate that the application is ready?](..) 
- Finally, you will execute the In-App business model logic using the different actions that we make available. [See available actions](...)

### Nexo

As we mentioned, it is the SDK to establish communication between the Admin and the In-admin App. This SDK developed by Nuvemshop compatible with Typescript and available through NPM

- Being the bridge for communications between the Admin and the In-admin App
- Defines and manages the available actions that are exchanged through messages. [See available actions](...)
- Provides tools to make easier the implementation of actions in the application.  [Learn more about the Helpers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tiendanube/nexo#helpers)

### Admin
Admin actor is responsible for managing the currently logged in Nuvemshop merchant, which means:
- Activate development mode: allows developers to test applications without the need of them being formally approved in our Appstore ([see below how to activate this for your app](#-developer-mode))
- Define the access for the application (routes): Nuvemshop will provide you with a route (URL), in which your application will be summoned.
- Defines where the application will have to be loaded through an iframe
- Initializes Nexo to be able to receive and send messages according to the needs of the application
- It is responsible for checking if the application is ready to be displayed
- Manage session tokens and share with the app through Nexo to know which Store is logged in


## üö¶Application initialization flow
Below we will describe the initiation flow of an In-admin App from the moment the user decides to view the application.

1. The user decides to open the application, it can be launched through a URL (stored as bookmarks) or an option in the menu.
2. The admin gets the app information and proceeds to load the In-admin App in an iframe. While the Admin shows a loading message.
3. After the In-admin App has loaded it will have to notify through Nexo that he is already connected and it will receive as a response that the Admin is also connected.
4. Finally, when the In-admin App is ready to display the content, it will have to notify through Nexo "I am ready". In this way, Admin will be able to replace the loading message with the application.

## üí¨ Introduction to Nexo
It is a tool developed by Nuvemshop that allows us to establish communication with the Admin and also manage the actions that can be carried out between the application and the administrator.

Nexo is available through NPM
```bash
npm install @tiendanube/nexo
```

It is an essential requirement that the application generates an instance of Nexo to be able to execute the actions

The Nexo instance allows you to enter 2 parameters to start:


| Config   |  Type                     | Description                                                        |
|----------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| clientId | `string` required         | App Id, this value is provided by Nuvemshop in Partners Portal      |
| log      | `boolean` default `false` | Allows to show the message transfers between the App and the Admin |

The logs are available through the browser console

## üíª Developer Mode
> This functionality is only available for previously enabled Stores. To access this functionality, request it through a contact at Nuvemshop

With the Developer Mode option activated you will have a new option available in the menu with the name "*Aplicativo de teste o Aplicaci√≥n de Prueba*". By entering this option you can enter the URL of the application
