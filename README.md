# ‚òÅÔ∏è App in Admin

> The objective of this project is to provide the developer with tools and examples to create an embedded application in Admin of Nuvemshop. We will also find 3 example applications in react, vanilla and api

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Let's start

Before we start let's do a macro view to understand the main actors with their responsibilities and initiation flow

### üé≠ Actors
#### Admin
Nuvemshop admin with merchants logged
- Activate development mode `dev mode`
- Define the access for the application `routes`
- Access the application through the iframe `iframe`
- Start Nexo for message exchange `bridge`
- Check if the application is ready to load within the Admin `verify`
- Management of session token that will validate the authenticity of a Store with an active session `authentication`

#### Nexo
Tool developed in JS for the communication between the Admin and the Application
- Being the bridge for communications between the Admin and the Application `bridge`
- Management of actions `patterns`
- Tools provider `tools`

#### App in admin

## üí¨ Introduction to Nexo
It is a tool developed by Nuvemshop that allows us to establish communication with the Admin and also manage the actions that can be carried out between the application and the administrator.

Nexo is available through NPM
```bash
npm install @tiendanube/nexo
```

It is an essential requirement that the application generates an instance of Nexo to be able to execute the actions

The Nexo instance allows you to enter 2 parameters to start:


| Config   |  Type                     | Description                                                        |
|----------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| clientId | `string` required         | This value is provided by Nuvemshop                                |
| log      | `boolean` default `false` | Allows to show the message transfers between the App and the Admin |

The logs are available through the browser console
